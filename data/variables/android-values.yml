monitoring_min_speed_descr: "This is a low-speed cut-off filter to not record points below a certain speed. This may make recorded tracks look \"smoother\" when viewed on the map."
monitoring_min_speed_descr_side_effect: "Side effect: Your track will be missing all sections where the minimum speed criterion was not met (e.g. where you push your bike up a steep hill). Also, there will be no information about periods at rest, like breaks. This has effects on any analysis or post-processing, like when trying to determine the total length of your trip, time in motion, or your average speed."
monitoring_min_speed_descr_recommendation: "Recommendation: Try using the motion detection via the \"logging minimum displacement\" filter (B) first, it may produce better results, and you will lose less data. If your tracks remain noisy at low speeds, try non-zero values here. Please note that some measurements may not report any speed value at all (some network-based methods), in which case you would not record anything."
monitoring_min_speed_descr_remark: "Remark: \"speed > 0\" check: Most GPS chipsets report a speed value only if the algorithm determines you are in motion, and none if you are not. Hence using the \"> 0\" setting in this filter in a sense uses the motion detection of the GPS chipset. But even if not filtered here at recording time, we still use this feature in our GPX analysis to determine the \"Distance corrected\", i.e. the value displayed in that field is the \"distance recorded while in motion\"."
monitoring_min_accuracy_descr: "This will record only points measured with a minimum \"accuracy\" indication (in meters/feet, as reported by Android for your chipset). Accuracy is the proximity of measurements to the true position, and is not directly related to precision, which is the scatter of repeated measurements."
monitoring_min_accuracy_descr_side_effect: "Side effect: As a result of filtering by accuracy, points may be entirely missing for e.g. below bridges, under trees, between high buildings, or with certain weather conditions."
monitoring_min_accuracy_descr_recommendation: "Recommendation: It is hard to predict what will be recorded and what not, it may be best to turn this filter off."
monitoring_min_accuracy_descr_remark: "Remark: If GPS had been off immediately before a recording, the first point measured may have a decreased accuracy,so in our code we may want to wait a second or so before recording a point (or record the best of 3 consecutive points, etc.), but this is not yet implemented."
monitoring_min_distance_descr: "This filter avoids duplicate points being recorded where too little actual motion may have occurred, makes a nicer spatial appearance of tracks not post-processed later."
monitoring_min_distance_descr_side_effect: "Side effects: Periods at rest are not recorded at all or by just one point each. Small (real world) movements (e.g. sideways, to mark a possible turnoff on your trip) may be filtered out. Your file contains less information for post-processing, and has worse stats by filtering out obviously redundant points at recording time, while potentially keeping artifacts caused by bad reception or GPS chipset effects."
monitoring_min_distance_descr_recommendation: "Recommendation: A setting of 5 meters may work well for you if you do not require to capture details finer than that, and do not want to explicitly capture data while at rest."

    Any of these maps can either be used as the main (base) map to be displayed, or as an overlay or underlay to another base map (like OsmAnd's standard offline maps). Certain elements of the OsmAnd vector maps can be hidden via the 'Configure map' menu to make any underlay map more visible.  
    Download tile maps directly online, or prepared them for offline use (manually copied to OsmAnd's data folder) as an SQLite database which can be produced by a variety of 3rd party map preparation tools."
record_plugin_name: "Trip recording"
record_plugin_description: "This plugin activates the functionality to record and save your tracks by manually touching the GPX logging widget on the map, or also to automatically log all of your navigation routes to a GPX file.  
    Recorded tracks can be shared with your friends or be used for OSM contributions. Athletes can use recorded tracks to monitor their trainings. Some basic track analysis can be performed directly in OsmAnd, like lap times, average speed etc., and tracks can of course also later be analyzed in special 3rd party analysis tools."

This functionality will be much appreciated by athletes, hikers, trekkers, and anybody interested in the relief structure of a landscape.  
    The global data (between 70 ° north and 70 ° south) is based on measurements by SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) and ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer), an imaging instrument onboard Terra, the flagship satellite of NASA's Earth Observing System. ASTER is a cooperative effort between NASA, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and Japan Space Systems (J-spacesystems)."

plugin_touringview_name: "Touring map view"
plugin_touringview_descr: "Activating this view changes OsmAnd's map style to 'Touring view', this is a special high-detail view for travelers and professional drivers.
		  This view provides, at any given map zoom, the maximum amount of travel details available in the map data (particularly roads, tracks, paths, and orientation marks).
		  It also clearly depicts all types of roads unambiguously by color coding, which is useful when e.g. driving large vehicles.
		  And it provides special touring options like showing bicycle routes or Alpine mountain routes.
		  A special map download is not needed, the view is created from our standard maps.
		  This view can be reverted by either de-activating it again here, or by changing the 'Map style' under 'Configure map' as desired."
plugin_nautical_name: "Nautical map view"
plugin_nautical_descr: "This plugin enriches the OsmAnd map and navigation app to also produce nautical maps for boating, sailing, and other types of watersports.
		  A special map add-on for OsmAnd will provide all nautical navigation marks and chart symbols, for inland as well as for nearshore navigation. The description of each navigation mark provides the details needed to identify them and their meaning (category, shape, color, sequence, reference, etc.).
		  To return to one of OsmAnd's conventional map styles, simply either de-activate this plugin again, or change the 'Map style' under 'Configure map' as desired."
plugin_ski_name: "Ski map view"
plugin_ski_descr: "This plugin for OsmAnd puts at your fingertips details of global downhill ski slopes, cross country ski runs, Alpine ski routes, cable cars and ski lifts. Routes and pistes are shown color-coded by difficulty, and depicted in a special 'Winter' map style which assimilates a snow-colored winter landscape.
		  Activating this view changes the map style to 'Winter and ski', showing all landscape features under wintry conditions. This view can be reverted by either de-activating it again here, or by changing the 'Map style' under 'Configure map' as desired."

		- Complete offline functionality (store downloaded vector or tile maps in the device storage) 
		- Compact offline vector maps for the whole world available 
		- Download country or region maps directly from the app 
		- Overlay of several map layers possible, like GPX or navigation tracks, points of interest, Favorites, contour lines, public transport stops, additional maps with customizable transparency 
		- Offline search for addresses and places (POIs) 
		- Offline routing for medium-range distances 
		- Car, bicycle, and pedestrian modes with optional: 
		-  Automated day/night view switching 
		-  Speed-dependent map zooming 
		-  Map alignment according to compass or direction of motion 
		-  Lane guidance, speed limit display, recorded and text-to-speech voices  

		Limitations of this free version of OsmAnd:
